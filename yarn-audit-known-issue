This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list.\n\nThe main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.\n\n### Patches\n\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94\n\nAn initial fix went out with `express@4.19.0`, we then patched a feature regression in `4.19.1` and added improved handling for the bypass in `4.19.2`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe fix for this involves pre-parsing the url string with either `require('node:url').parse` or `new URL`.

validation","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"## Description: \nDuring some analysis today on npm's `node-tar` package I came across the folder creation process, Basicly if you provide node-tar with a path like this `./a/b/c/foo.txt` it would create every folder and sub-folder here a, b and c until it reaches the last folder to create `foo.txt`, In-this case I noticed that there's no validation at all on the amount of folders being created, that said we're actually able to CPU and memory consume the system running node-tar and even crash the nodejs client within few seconds of running it using a path with too many sub-folders inside\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\nYou can reproduce this issue by downloading the tar file I provided in the resources and using node-tar to extract it, you should get the same behavior as the video\n\n## Proof Of Concept:\nHere's a
